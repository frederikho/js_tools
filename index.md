## Welcome to my extremely interesting and useful website

I have developed some scripts for everyone to enjoy them. Have a look and enjoy. 

My first script in javascript is the following: [Link](universe.html). 

My second script in javascript is this one: [Swanky Swarm](swanky_swarm.html). 

My third script in javascript is here: [Triangle game](triangle_game.html). 

The fourth thing I did is the following: [Deal or no deal](deal_or_no_deal/index.html).

<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/p5/p5.min.js"></script>
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/p5/addons/p5.sound.min.js"></script>
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/boid.js"></script>
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/sketch.js"></script>
